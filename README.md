# StakeDao Contract

Users can obtain the same amount of DD (DeHorizon DAO) by staking a certain amount of DEVT.

The minimum amount of DEVT required for single staking will increase as the number of days increases.

DD is the membership certificate of each DAO member, which stands for the rights of participating in DAO governance, voting, and much more.

Currently, DD does not have a transaction function, and whether to add this function in the future will be decided by DAO members by voting.

DD can be swapped into DEVT at any time, but only swapping all DD is allowed. After the swap is completed, it means that you have withdrawn from DAO.





Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

npx hardhat node
npm run test

```
