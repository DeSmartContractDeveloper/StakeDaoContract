# StakeDao Contract

Users can obtain the same amount of DSD by staking DEVT

DSD stands for DEVT Staking DAO. They are DEVT locked for the purpose of voting.

DSD is not allowed to be traded, but in the future, you can vote through proposals in the DAO to determine whether it can be traded

The minimum amount of DEVT required for a single pledge will increase as the number of days increases.

DSD can be exchanged for DEVT at any time, but once initiated, all DSD must be exchanged at once.

You can only vote using your voting weight at the block where a proposal was created.





Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

npx hardhat node
npm run test

```
